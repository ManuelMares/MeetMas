    <h2>
        Participation files
    </h2>
    <p>
        MeetMas creates, keeps track and provides you with cvs (Excel) files for the participation registry in your meetings<br/>
        You are in control of when the files are created, which file you are using, and what is considered a participation.
    </p>

    <h3>
        Creating new participation files
    </h3>
    <p>
        Everytime you open a meet, a menu will popup, allowing you to select, edit and create a new participation file.
        This menu can also be accessed from the interface button 'select meet'. <br/>
        The only requirement to create a participation file is to indicate a new name for it. Although the new created file will store the 
        meeting link where it was created as metadata, you can update this link in the future by chosing to edit the file while in the new meet. <br>
        Notice that a single meeting can have as many participation files as you require, and you can use a file in any meeting you open.<br>

    </p>

    <h3>
        Working with participation files
    </h3>
    <p>
        When a meet is started and a participation file is selected from the initial menu, new buttons and menus will appear to help you register participations for the active participants in the most efficient way.
    </p>
        <h4>
            Adding participants to the register
        </h4>
        <p>
            Keep track of all the participants that have ever been in your meet is as easy as keep the members menu open.<br>
            Everytime a new participant enters the meet, and as long as the members menu is open, the participant will be registered automatically.<br> 
            This action only has to be done once per participant. Once the new participant is registered, everything is setup to keep working normally!
        </p>
        <h4>Register a participation</h4>
        <p>
            There are three sets of buttons that allow you to register participations:
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Participation buttons from the chat 
                </li>
                <li>
                    Participation buttons from the members menu 
                </li>
                <li>
                    Participation buttons from the MeetMas menu 
                </li>
            </ul>
            Click on the + button to add a participation, and on the - button to subtract it. When any of the buttons is clicked, a temporary notification will confirm th action
            You can register as many participation as you want, and the final count will be a balance: total participations = positive participations - negative participations.<br>
            Negative total participations are allowed.
        </p>
        <h4>Edit a participation file</h4>
        <p>
            In the initial menu, click on the yellow button in order to change the name of your file
        </p>
        <h4>Delete participation file</h4>
        <p>
            In the initial menu, click on the red button of the participation file to delete.<br>
            Be careful, this action cannot be undone, so it is a good idea to download the file first in case you need to use in the future as a backup file to create a new participation file
        </p>
        
    <h3>
        MeetMas Menu
    </h3>
    <p>
        MeetMas menu is available when a participation file is selected in order to take advantage of the participants register system. <br>
        To open the menu, click on the MeetMas Menu button on the top left corner of the meet. The menu will display on the right just as all the native menus do.<br>
        Once the menu is open, you can see all the members that have ever been part of you meeting, and keep track of their participations. 
        Additionally, new features are provided as button on the top part
    </p>
        <h4>
            Update MeetMas Menu
        </h4>
        <p>
            As mentioned before, all new users can only be registered when the members menu is open. 
            You can use the Update list shortcut to trigger this action. When done, the MeetMas Menu will be displayed automatically again
        </p>
        <h4>
            Random participant
        </h4>
        <p>
            A random member of your meet will be polled. The list of users will be the historical list provided in the menu, not the list
            of active members displayed in the regular members menu.<br>
            An active notification will be displayed to indicate you the polled member
        </p>
        <h4>
            Smart Random Participant
        </h4>
        <p>
            The users will be sorted to identify the members with less participations. From this resultant list, a random user will be polled<br>
            When the user gets selected, an active notification will be displayed.
        </p>
        <h4>
            Excluding members from the polling
        </h4>
        <p>
            This feature remains to be implemented due to the logic complexity, but here we provide you with a work around for the Smart Random Participant function:
            For the users you want to exclude, add a relative large amount of participations.
        </p>
        <h3>
            Download participation files
        </h3>
        <p>
            The downloading of participation files can be done anywhere and at any time, but only from the popup menu.<br>
            Click in the extension icon to display the popup, then identify the file you want to download, and click in the download button to obtain the file.
