    <h1>
       Understanding the Participation Files
    </h1>
    <p>
        MeetMas creates, keeps track and provides you with cvs (Excel) files to register the participation in your meetings. They are known as Participation Files. <br/>
        You are in control of when the files are created, which file you are using (and where), and what is considered a participation.
    </p>
        <h2>
            Participation Files Menu
        </h2>
        <p>
            This menu appears every time you start a new meeting and it is available only while a meeting is open. This menu might look similar to the popup menu, but while the former one has the main purpose of managing the extension's settings (plus other handy functions), 
            this menu focuses in managing the list of Participation Files only.
        </p>
        <img class="HomePage_img" src="chrome-extension://dhijdfaoedpfdaeggoocdclejichafac/HomePage/ParticipationFilesMenu.png" alt="Participation Files Menu">
        <p>
            This menu can be accessed at any other time while in a meeting, through the button "Participation Files" in the top left menu. This button might been hidden by the collapsed menu
        </p>
        <img class="HomePage_img" src="chrome-extension://dhijdfaoedpfdaeggoocdclejichafac/HomePage/ParticipationFilesButton.png" alt="Participation Files Button">
        
        <h2>
            Creating New Participation Files
        </h2>
        <p>
            Open the Participation File Menu, and click in the 'new participation file' button at the bottom. The only requirement to create a participation file is to indicate a new name for it. 
            The link where the file is created will be stored as part of the metadata providing you with easy access to it from the popup menu. This link can be updated.
            Notice that a single meeting can be used to create as many participation files as you require. Also, you can use any participation file in any meeting you open. 
            However, this is not recommended and it is discouraged.<br>

        </p>

        <h2>
            Load Participation Files
        </h2>
        <p>
            In order to avoid confusion, this option is only available in the popup menu. <br/>
            While the popup menu is open, the middle section will allow you to load the participation file. Be very carefully in how this file is manipulated before uploading it.
            The participation file has to be a cvs file, and has to be formatted in the original style. If you have modify it and are not sure of how it should look, you can download a new participation file and copy its structure.<br/>
            It is also important to notice that the name used to store the file is the one indicated inside the file, in the field 'meet name', instead of the file name.
            <br>
        </p>
        <p class="remark"> 

            It is recommended that once the file has been uploaded, you downloaded it again to verify that the format is the expected one, or to make the corresponding corrections. <br/>
            The order of the participants is not guaranteed to be the same as the one from the uploaded file. That should be the only acceptable difference
        </p>

        <h2>
            Edit the Participation File's Metadata
        </h2>
        <p>
            In the Participation File Menu, identify the file you want to edit, then click in the yellow icon to modify it.<br>
            A new menu will show up, allowing you to update the name. It will also give you the option of updating the link to the meet you have open right now.<br>
            The link cannot be manually updated to any other value or any other menu to guarantee that the links used are always valid and useful from the popup menu.
        </p>
        <h2>Delete Participation Files</h2>
        <p>
            In the Participation Files Menu, identify the file you want to edit, then click in the red button to modify it.<br>
            Be careful, this action cannot be undone, so it is a good idea to download the file first from the popup, and use it as a backup file in case you need it in the future.
        </p>












    <h1>
        Working with Participation Files
    </h1>
    <p>
        Once you have created and selected a participation file to work with, you can use the interface buttons to simplify your work.
    </p>
        <h2>
            Adding Participants
        </h2>
        <p>
            The list of members provided by Google Meets is the only and necessary way of adding new participants to the registry.
            The registration occurs automatically, as long as this members menu is visible. <br>
            Make sure you open the members menu at least once when new participants are added to the menu. 
        </p>
        <img class="HomePage_img" src="chrome-extension://dhijdfaoedpfdaeggoocdclejichafac/HomePage/members_menu.png" alt="Members Menu">
        <h2>Registering a participation</h2>
        <p>
            This action can be done from the members menu or the chat (also from the MeetMas Menu). <br>
            Next to each member's name, you will find out a set of two buttons: a green one to increase the participation by one, and a blue one to decrease it by one.
            Once a participation is added, a notification will appear confirming the action. <br/>
            You will notice that you cannot add a participation to yourself from the chat, but it is still possible to do it from the members menu.<br/>
            It is possible to leave participants with negative total participations.
        </p>

    <h1>
        MeetMas Menu
    </h1>
    <p>
        The MeetMas menu is available only when a participation file is selected. Its goal is to take advantage of the participants register system. <br>
        To open the menu, click on the MeetMas Menu button on the top left corner of the meet. The menu will display on the right just as all the native menus do.<br>
    </p>
    <img class="HomePage_img" src="chrome-extension://dhijdfaoedpfdaeggoocdclejichafac/HomePage/MeetMas_menu_button.png" alt="Members Menu">
    
    <p>    
        Once the menu is open, you can see all the members that have ever been part of you meeting, and keep adding participations. 
        Additionally, new features are provided as button on the top part
    </p>

        <h2>
            Update MeetMas Menu
        </h2>
        <p>
            As mentioned before, all new users can only be registered when the members menu is open. 
            You can use the 'Update MeetMas Menu' shortcut to trigger this action. This button will display the members menu momentarelly, then it will bring back the updated MeeMas Menu.  
        </p>
        <h2>
            Random participant
        </h2>
        <p>
            A random member of your meet will be polled. The user will be obtained from the historical list provided in the MeeMas Menu;
            that is, it will include all the members that have ever been in the meeting, not just the ones that are present in the moment. <br/>
            An active notification will be displayed to indicate you the name of the polled member.
        </p>
        <h2>
            Smart Random Participant
        </h2>
        <p>
            The users will be sorted to identify the members with less participations. From this resultant list, a random user will be polled<br>
            When the user gets selected, an active notification will be displayed.
        </p>
        <p class="remark">
            To exclude particular members from the smart polling, you can add an arbitrary large amount of participations to them, in such way that there are members with less participations than them, and they get excluded from the polling. 
        </p>
